# Linux-Server-P5-
Project 5 for Udacity Nanodegree program

### Description
This project involves taking a baseline Linux installation from "zero to hero."  I created an instance on AWS Lightsail and configured it properly for security and performance (see steps).  I then cloned my previous project Item Catalog and made it available online through and IP address.

### Steps
1. Log in via SSH and upgrade packages:
  I used the SSH button found on AWS log in to my instance.  I then used the following commands to upgrade my packages:
  '''
    * sudo apt-get update
    * sudo apt-get upgrade
  '''
